abstract: The number of studies considering building performance optimization
  (BPO) in the building design phase is steadily growing, but many of the
  existing studies do not consider the applicability of many-objective
  optimization algorithms when increasing the objective dimensions. This article
  first compares the NSGA-II, IDBEA, MSOPS-II, and NSGA-III algorithms. Then,
  the algorithm most suitable for many-objective optimization is combined with
  Artificial natural network(ANN) and TOPSIS-AHP to complete the optimization of
  four dimensions of building energy consumption (EC), useful daylight
  illuminance (UDI), comfort time ratio (CTR) and energy-saving envelope cost
  (ESEC) for village houses in cold regions of China. The results show that the
  NSGA-III algorithm performs well in terms of convergence speed, convergence,
  diversity, and uniformity when solving many-objective problems compared to the
  other three algorithms. Finally, four optimization strategies were selected
  using the TOPSIS-AHP method.
