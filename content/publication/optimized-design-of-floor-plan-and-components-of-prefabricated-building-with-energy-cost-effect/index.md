abstract: Optimizing building performance and economic benefits through feedback
  in building design is a hot topic in current academic research. However, few
  studies on prefabricated buildings have been undertaken in this field.
  Meanwhile, the methodology used for achieving optimized solutions is still
  poor. In this paper, genetic algorithms and correlation analysis are employed
  and two parametric design methods—i.e., the floor plan generation method and
  the component selection method—are proposed for the modularity of the
  prefabricated buildings. Taking a typical high-rise building in Tianjin as an
  example, correlation analyses are performed on the basis of the two proposed
  methods to enhance the depth of the optimized finding approach. The outcome of
  this research demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed numerical approach,
  which can produce the optimized floor plan and construction set under the
  local conditions. This also reveals that the shape coefficient and
  window-to-wall ratio are strongly correlated with the energy performance of a
  building, which can help architects to pursue optimized design solutions in
  the schematic design process.
