abstract: This study is the first to conduct a global sensitivity analysis to
  identify the crucial variables that have an impact on the energy consumption
  of substations. The peak cooling and heating energy consumption, as well as
  the annual cooling and heating energy consumption of a substation in Shandong,
  are all simulated basing the Monte Carlo method. The simulation outputs are
  discussed by uncertainty analysis to obtain more accurate energy consumption
  thresholds. Subsequently, the treed Gaussian process and the standardized rank
  regression coefficient are used to perform a global sensitivity analysis of
  the simulation outputs. The results of the two global sensitivity analyses are
  practically the same, demonstrating that robustness can be ensured by
  simultaneously using two methods based on different theories. In addition,
  this study provides an efficient method for the energy-saving retrofitting of
  the existing substation and the energy-saving design of green substations in
  the future.
